# AWS Timestream Datasource Development Guide

The Timestream datasource plugin provides a support for [Amazon Timestream](https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/). Add it as a data source, then you are ready to build dashboards using timestream query results

Please add feedback to the [issues](https://github.com/grafana/timestream-datasource/issues) folder, and we will follow up shortly. Be sure to include version information for both grafana and the installed plugin.

The production plugins can be downloaded from [the Timestream plugin page](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-timestream-datasource/).

For configuration options, see: [src/README.md](src/README.md)
